<b> May 2020 GPU Hackathon at SDSC</b><br>

<p><b>The GPU Hackathon is coming to San Diego!</b>

  <p class="sectitle">If you have an application that you are thinking about porting to GPUs,
or an application already using GPUs that could use a helping hand getting
that next level of performance, you should consider submitting to the
<b>San Diego GPU Hackathon.</b></p>

      <p class="sectitle">What is a GPU hackathon?</p>
  </td>
  <td align='left' valign='top'>
    <p id="paral">SDSC GPU hackathons are 5-day intensive coding events that put
    application teams together with experts in programming and performance.
    The goal of the event is to port and optimize codes on GPU technologies
    in a focused, highly collaborative environment. GPU hackathons are part
    of an international program organized by NVIDIA to help train scientists
    and researchers to accelerate and optimize their applications on GPUs.</p>

  <p class="sectitle">What is the format? WHAT?</p>
</td>
<td align='left' valign='top'>
    Each code team should consist of 4-6 code developers that together are
    intimately knowledgeable of the code. If a team proposal consists
    of a suite of applications, no more than two applications should
    be sent to the hackathon. For each individual code, at least 2 people
    must attend. Teams will be complimented by mentors that will be
    assigned based on expert knowledge that matches the needs of the code.
    Expertise in GPU computing is not required.
    Selected teams will have access to large-scale GPU clusters
    for the duration of the event, including preparation and follow-up testing.

      <b>Who should attend?</b>
  </td>
  <td align='left' valign='top'>
    Anyone developing or using HPC scientific codes seeking performance
    improvements, or porting to GPU systems in a cooperative, hands-on
    environment should apply. Codes should primarily be written in a GPU
    compatible language, such as C++, Fortran and/or Python.
    Codes can use/want any standard method of offloading work to the GPUs,
    including CUDA, RAPIDS, CUDA Fortran, OpenACC, OpenCL or OpenMP.
    The SDSC GPU hackathon is interested in teams who are working with
    “long-tail” computational science applications that run well on the
    Comet (or future Expanse) architectures. However, all coding teams
    looking to use GPU technologies are encouraged to apply. A broad
    range of code types and GPU experience levels are sought for this event.

    There is no registration fee to attend the event. Breakfast,
    lunch, coffee and snacks will be provided during the hackathon.
    Participants are responsible for all other expenses, including
    their transportation to and from the event, lodgings and other
    meals. Participants will also be expected to arrive with a
    laptop that is capable of wireless internet to work on for
    the duration of the event.
